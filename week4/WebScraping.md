What is webscraping?

Extracting data from a website, usually by referencing CSS selectors such as specific titles so that the specific data is scraped. This is done to get the data in a format that may be easier to analyze. 

We make use of the scrapy python package to be able to do web scraping.

Web crawling (also known as a spider) refers to accessing the data from a website. 

There are some rules that specific websites outline where we are advised not to/not allowed to access eg ones outline in facebook.com/robots.txt

However, you have the option to change as to whether you want to access that data via changing the status of robots.txt to true or false in your project folder.
