We create a project folder in python with the scrapy package imported into it and an
associated virtual environment created that allows us to work only within that so that
the rest of our pc is not affected by the work done in the folder. 

Upon the folder creation with the associated virenv made, we can see the following default
folders already created:
- __init__.py

This is required for the project initlization
- items.py
- middlewares.py

so you can work through proxies during data extraction
- pipelines.py
- settings.py
