MODULES AND PACKAGES

Packages are a collection of many modules. Modules are separate logical components that would allow better structuring and flow of the code.

A package can contain modules of similar attributes or functionalities, eg a String package would contain all related modules to strings functions.  

How to import modules from packages:

from -package name- import -module name- 

or

from -package name.module name- import -function name-


then you can create a new instance of that class to use accordingly.
