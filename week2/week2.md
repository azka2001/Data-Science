SEPTEMBER 5 - BASICS OF PYTHON

- to print information we simply use the print function
- programs in python get executed from top to bottom
- variable types do not need to be declared
- strings can be written in double or single quotes
- use underscore to separate multiple words in variable names
- python is a case sensitive language
- False and True are case sensitive values 
- input() is a function to get input from the user
- to be able to give the user a prompt to give input, we write a string asking for the input as an argument to the input function
- TYPE CONVERSION:
- to be able to convert the input type to int, we write int(input())
- for float just write variable as float()
- and for bool its bool()
- for string str()
- there are multiple functions available that are specific to strings (are known as functions as we are referring to an object)
- these include: .lower(),.upper(),.find('a'),.replace('to replace','replace with')
- strings are immutable in python
- in operator can be used to find a specific word in a string with the return value being a boolean
- we can use arithmetic operators such as + - * /
- / will return float value
- // will return int value 
- % returns remainder
- exponent is indicated by **
- to increment +=
- to decrement -=
- these are called augmented assignment operators
- OPERATOR PRECEDENCE:
- * and / have precedence over + -, can change the precedence using brackets
- COMPARISON OPERATORS
- >, <, >=, <=, == (to check equality), !=
- LOGICAL OPERATORS:
- and, or, not (this inverses the expression)
- CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
- you write it in this format:
- if statement:
- (indent) expression
- elif statement:
- (indent) expression
- else:
- (indent) expression
- LOOPS:
- while i<5:
- expression
- incremental expression
- to make number more readable you can write it like 1_000
- you can also print a string value multiple times eg
- i * '*' 
- this will increment it each time 
- LISTS:
- you can write lists like:
- name = [a,b,c] 
- you separate values with ,
- you can use index to access each value
- name[-1] will represent the last value and -2 the second last
- you can replace values etc, like in an array
- LIST METHODS:
