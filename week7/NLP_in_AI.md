NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

What is NLP?
Computers replicating the method and way of communication between human beings, either between
two computers or between a computer and a human being. 

Applications of NLP:
- Speech Recognition eg Siri, Google Assistant where the computer understands the speech input
and properly gives an analysed response
- Sentimental Analysis: via social media where analysis of posts can inform as to whether the
post has happy or sad sentiments
- Machine Translation: Google Translation
- ChatBots: Smart chatbots that can provide valid replies from the information in their database

What happens in automatic speech recognition:
- The speech is converted into text
- NLU : Natural language understanding/Natural Language Intrepreter
- NLG : Natural Language Generation: the reply to be given

Challenges in NLU:
- Lexical Ambiguity: whatever words we speak get tokenized into separate words so there could be
an issue that one word has multiple meanings
- Syntactic Ambiguity: The structure of the sentence should be valid otherwise it would not be
interpreted properly
- Semantic Ambiguity: What is the meaning of the sentence? The sentence should be clear in its
meaning
- Pragmatic Ambiguity: The context of the phrase may provide multiple intrepretations 

Challenges in NLG:
- What should we say to the user? 
1. Intelligent and conversational in context of the question of the user
2. Deal with structured data
3. Text/Sentence Planning
Corpus -> the entire database

You first must decide with text or words to make use of, and then decide the sentence
structure that should be applied.
