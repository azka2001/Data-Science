SEPTEMBER 5 - BASICS OF PYTHON

- to print information we simply use the print function
- programs in python get executed from top to bottom
- variable types do not need to be declared
- strings can be written in double or single quotes
- use underscore to separate multiple words in variable names
- python is a case sensitive language
- False and True are case sensitive values 
- input() is a function to get input from the user
- to be able to give the user a prompt to give input, we write a string asking for the input as an argument to the input function
- TYPE CONVERSION:
- to be able to convert the input type to int, we write int(input())
- for float just write variable as float()
- and for bool its bool()
- for string str()
